# WEATHER-STATION
Tinkering around with Raspberry Pi, Arduino/Atmega, some seonsors, Python3, C and rrdtool for Aquisition and Visualization of weather data. Just for fun and for learning.
### why? what is it?
it is my little playground for learning how to use Python, C, rrdtool and some affordable hardware for data aquisition and especially the visualization of data. I just like this stuff. Weather data is something, that can (more or less, hahaha..) easily be collected and it is worth to look at. Besides, I like diagrams. RRDTOOL provides fantastic means for visualization and the idea of a round robin database itself is kind of ingenious.
